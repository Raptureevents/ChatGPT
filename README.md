This repository contains a simple desktop task management application written in Python using `tkinter`.

## Running the Application

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8+ recommended). Tkinter is typically included with standard Python installations. Run the application with:

```bash
python tasks_app.py
```

Tasks are saved in `tasks.json` in the project directory so you can close and reopen the application without losing your list.
