# Task Manager Server

This Express backend uses PostgreSQL for storing users, tasks, projects, events and expenses. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` with your database connection string.

## Development

Install dependencies and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server exposes endpoints under `/api` for login, tasks, projects, events and expenses.
